# Ticket Index

This file tracks planned, active, and completed tickets.

## How to use
- The single source of truth for ticket execution is this file.
- Codex executes only the ticket listed in **Active Ticket** with scope defined in **Active Ticket Spec**.
- Every ticket pass must update:
  - **Upcoming Tickets** (current and deduplicated)
  - **Completed Tickets** (append-only)

## Active Ticket
- ID: (none)
- Title: (none)

## Active Ticket Spec
