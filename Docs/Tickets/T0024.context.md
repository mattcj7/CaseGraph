# Ticket Context Pack: T0024 - Timeline View v1 (Messages-first)
# Ticket Context Pack: T0024 - Timeline View v1 (Messages-first)

## Purpose
Add a Messages-first Timeline page that lists MessageEvents in time order with filters + paging, reusing existing provenance, audit logging, and participant resolution patterns.

## Canonical links (do not paste content)
- [Ticket index](Docs/TICKETS.md)
- [Invariants](Docs/INVARIANTS.md)
- [Architecture](Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Data model](Docs/DATA_MODEL.md)
- [Workflow](Docs/Ticket_Context_Workflow.md)

## Files to open (whitelist)
- Docs/Tickets/T0024.md
- Docs/Tickets/T0024.context.md

### New files to create (deterministic; safe to whitelist now)
- src/CaseGraph.App/Views/TimelinePage.xaml
- src/CaseGraph.App/Views/TimelinePage.xaml.cs
- src/CaseGraph.App/ViewModels/TimelineViewModel.cs
- src/CaseGraph.Infrastructure/Timeline/TimelineQueryService.cs
- src/CaseGraph.Infrastructure/Timeline/TimelineRowDto.cs
- tests/CaseGraph.Infrastructure.Tests/TimelineQueryServiceTests.cs

### Existing files (add ONLY after you identify exact paths in your repo)
> During implementation, you will need to wire the page into left-nav/navigation and reuse existing provenance + audit helpers.
> Once you locate the exact files, add them here BEFORE modifying them:
- src/CaseGraph.App/Views/<YourShellOrMainWindow>.xaml
- src/CaseGraph.App/ViewModels/<YourShellOrMainViewModel>.cs
- src/CaseGraph.App/<YourNavOrRoutesFile>.cs
- src/CaseGraph.Infrastructure/Audit/<YourAuditWriterOrService>.cs
- src/CaseGraph.Infrastructure/<YourWorkspaceDbFactoryOrQueryService>.cs
- src/CaseGraph.App/<YourProvenanceOpenSourceHelper>.cs

## Notes and constraints
- Offline-only implementation.
- Keep scope constrained to the active ticket.
- Must not load all MessageEvents into memory; use paging/virtualization.
- Must not rewrite MessageEvent evidence rows; resolve via query/projection.
- Timeline rows must expose provenance actions:
  - View Source (EvidenceItem + SourceLocator)
  - Copy Citation (EvidenceItem + SourceLocator)
- Timeline searches must be audited (preserve audit hash-chain semantics).
- Reuse existing participant/target/global-person resolution logic used by Search/Where-Seen (do not invent a second resolution path).
- If you need to touch files outside the whitelist, update this context pack first, then proceed.
