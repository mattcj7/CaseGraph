Usability Guidelines (Non-technical user friendly)
Goals

The app should feel like a “case binder with superpowers.”

Most common workflows should be discoverable without training.

Navigation (consistent left sidebar)

Import

Search

Timeline

People / Targets

Locations

Associations

Reports / Exports

Review Queue

Wizard-first workflows

Import Wizard (detect type, show what will be extracted, progress, completion summary)

Incident Window Wizard (time range + location radius → top hits and gaps)

Target Card Builder (start from phone/handle/name → build profile)

Report Builder (templates → preview → export)

Provenance one click away

Every UI item shown must provide:

View Source (EvidenceItem + SourceLocator)

Copy Citation

Review queues

Organize work into queues:

Unreviewed keyword hits

Merge candidates

Unattributed identifiers (numbers/handles)

Geo proximity hits

AI suggestions (later)

Language rules

Avoid jargon like “artifact nodes.”

Prefer: “Cellebrite UFDR report”, “Social export (ZIP)”, “Spreadsheet export”.
